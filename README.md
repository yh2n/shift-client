# restaurant-schedule-app

## Synopsis

This is a project motivated by the constant need of the restaurant industry to monitor _**F**ront **O**f the **H**ouse_ scheduling via a simple tool.

## Motivation
This app is destined for professionals of the restaurant industry in need of a quick and straighforward way to manage 
scheduling updates for the FOH. The vast majority of restaurants employees work part-time and pursue other professional endeavors, 
or go to college. Many of them need some shifts covered on a moment's notice and this results in a constant exchange of emails/messages
between coworkers. <br>Managers expect a notification of those changes and some may require their approval for various reasons. 

With this app, managers are able to enter all employees in their restaurant's database, edit and send the schedule. On the other hand, for any given shift
staff memebr can set their status to *need coverage* or *able to cover*. The app allows to connect easily people needing time off with people
looking for extra income...all without unnecessary emails, messages, phone calls.
